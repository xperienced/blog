In the meantime you can get a first impression how the app is going to look like and give me a feedback what do you think about it. Main target of this app - guitarist players that would like to learn how particular chords sound, useful if you are going to transcribe songs by yourself. Inspired by great series of lessons on <a href="www.justinguitar.com">www.justinguitar.com</a>.</p>
