<p>My full-time .NET development has taken all of my power recently and I realized I haven't posted anything since March 14th. I didn't post on time on <a href="http://idevblogaday.com/">idevblogaday</a> and I ended up on the last position of a waiting list.Â My excuse is that that Monday I was on a business trip in Langenfeld (Germany) and I was accommodated in a non-internet hotel (can you believe it?), my iPhone data roaming is turned off by default (and I don't want to change it :) which prevented me from posting on time ;)</p>
<p>Anyway, I am waiting for my next turn and I am pretty sure this time will be better (I am now #31). Recently I have made a small "demo" project for one of Polish telecom company - client-server Cocoa Touch application which utilizes RESTful Web Services and is mostly based on UITableViewControllers. I am going to post something on this topic in the coming days so, if you are interested, don't unsubscribe me from your reader and... see you soon!!!</p>
