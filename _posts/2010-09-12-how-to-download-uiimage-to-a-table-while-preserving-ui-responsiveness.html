<p>I found an interesting article the other day that deals with downloading data from a website.</p>
<p><a href="http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/05/downloading-images-for-table-without.html">http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.com/2010/05/downloading-images-for-table-without.html</a></p>
<p>A title of this post is quite misleading, and as few others pointed out, the NSURLConnection method that is being executed will internally spawn a thread (or take it from a thread pool) and perform a network operation on a background thread.</p>
