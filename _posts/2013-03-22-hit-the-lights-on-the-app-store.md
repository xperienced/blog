Well, it's been a while and today I am really happy to announce that my first game [Hit The Lights](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hit-the-lights/id559786742?ls=1&mt=8) is now live on the App Store. And what's important - you can download it for FREE! For those that didn't read my [previous]({% post_url 2012-09-21-introducing-hit-the-lights %}) [posts]({% post_url 2013-03-15-hit-the-lights-soon-on-app-stor %}) - Hit The Lights is a new take on laser puzzle, a challenging game for iPhone with a gameplay that reminds of and old, good "The Incredible Machine" series.

The goal of each level is simple – to connect laser emitters with corresponding receptors. You can find more information about a game on [official web page](http://hitthelightsgame.com) or on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hit-the-lights/id559786742?ls=1&mt=8).
Some technical details. The game was implemented with a help of [cocos2d v2.1](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org), all interfaces were designed in [CocosBuilder](http://cocosbuilder.com) and texture atlases were done with [TexturePacker](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker). I must admit that without these tools it will be much harder to create this game, so I really recommend this toolset for every developer. The game was implemented using [MVC pattern](http://xperienced.com.pl/blog/cocos2d-meets-mvc-implementing-board-game-part-1) that I [explained](http://xperienced.com.pl/blog/cocos2d-meets-mvc-%e2%80%93-implementing-simple-board-game-part-2) in [my other](http://xperienced.com.pl/blog/cocos2d-meets-mvc-implementing-simple-board-game-part-3) [posts](http://xperienced.com.pl/blog/cocos2d-meets-mvc-wrap-up).
