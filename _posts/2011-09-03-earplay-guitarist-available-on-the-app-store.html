EarPlay Guitarist is finally available on the App Store. Lite version got stuck in "in review" state but I bet it will be soon available as well. When the app is finally out I have some time to think about an update which will certainly include new lessons (new type of chords and maybe something extra). If you think there is something that might make this app better send me an info using my <a title="Contact" href="http://xperienced.com.pl/blog/contact">contact form</a>.</p>
