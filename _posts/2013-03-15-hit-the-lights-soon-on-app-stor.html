<p>After a year of development I am proud to announce a game that will be available on App Store <strong>21st of March</strong>. It is a project that I was doing independently (mostly at nights), it's based on cocos2d 2.1 and it's implemented with MVC pattern as described in my blog post here: <a title="cocos2d meets MVC – Implementing simple board game part 1" href="http://xperienced.com.pl/blog/cocos2d-meets-mvc-implementing-board-game-part-1">cocos2d meets MVC</a></p>
<p>Hit The Lights is a laser puzzle game for iPhone with one simple goal of each level – to connect light emitters with corresponding receptors. This might sound easy at first, but later on the game gets more challenging as you will need to learn how to properly use available game pieces to achieve each level’s goal. A mirror is the main piece in your toolbox, but there are more like splitters, prisms, color filters and more that will help you mix &amp; match the colors of emitters with correct receptors.</p>
